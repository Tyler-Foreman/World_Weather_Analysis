# World_Weather_Analysis

In this repository I have created a series of notebooks to help you plan your ideal vacation trip in the world based on desired weather.

- Within the Weather_Database folder in the repository, I have created a notebook to generate random latitudes/longitudes around the world, matching these lat/long pairs to a nearby city and then obtaining current weather data for each city.

- Within the Vacation_Search folder in the repository, I have created a notebook to request an input for your desired minimum and maximum temperature for your ideal vacation destination. Then I have reduced those preferred destinations and use Google Maps API to find nearby hotels to reside in.

- Within the Vacation_Itinerary folder in the repository, I have created a final notebook to define an ideal itinerary of multiple locations once you have chosen your preferred destination. I then use these locations to build out the proper itinerary for your ideal vacation and use Google Maps API to plot your route to each city, the hotel you will stay at, and the current weather conditions.
